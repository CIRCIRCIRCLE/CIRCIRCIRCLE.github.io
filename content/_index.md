I'm a first-year PhD student in [Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/research/information-and-communication-engineering) at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr.Anna Maria Mandalari](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/89052). I have a solid background in Machine Learning and Telecommunication. I am currently investigating Honeypots and IPv6 in the context of IoT security and privacy.
